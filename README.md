# nasa-website
A simple website for fans of NASA to start their journey on learning about NASA's achievements and more about outer space.

This started as an assignment from my web programming course provided by the faculty of computers and data science at Alexandria university, but I'll update as I learn more. I'm a big fan of NASA and outer space in general so this will be a fun way to showcase my learnings. :)

Currently only uses HTML and very simple CSS for some colours.
